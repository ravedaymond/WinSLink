[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1--beta-green.svg)](https://github.com/ravedaymond/WinSLink/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ravedaymond/WinSLink/blob/master/LICENSE)

*WinSLink* is a simple GUI tool for creating Symbolic Links for files or directories on Windows. 

Created as a personal tool for managing folders and files, I saw the ability to learn about Visual C# and the Windows Form Application by creating an application that could be shared with others.

## How To Use

Create Symbolic Links, also known as symlinks, for files or directories without the command line. Simple text input or file browsing for both Link and Target paths. Both Absolute and Relative link type options are available. Run the executable and fill in all required sections to create your symlink. 

WinSLink does require some prior knowledge of Symbolic Links. Help tooltips are provided on the application itself but are much more general in the information provided. 

For more information on Symbolic Link usage in Windows, view [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/symbolic-links), these helpful guides by [Tech Republic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-take-advantage-of-symbolic-links-in-window-10/) and/or [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/).

### Dependencies

This application is built with [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130).
