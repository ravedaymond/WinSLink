# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

The following are a set of guidelines for contribution to the WinSLink project. These are guidelines, not rules, so feel free to use your own judgement and please propose any changes to project documents in a pull request.

This is one of the first "open sourced" projects I have released let alone worked on, so any advice on document changes is more than welcome.

## Getting Started

WinSLink is an application created using Visual C# through a Windows Form Application. Please refer to official Microsoft documentation on [Visual C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/?view=vs-2017) or the creation of a [Windows Form Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project?view=vs-2017) if you are unfamiliar.

### Issue

Ensure that the issue or bug was not already reported by searching GitHub under the projects [issue tracker](https://github.com/ravedaymond/WinSLink/issues). If you are unable to find an open issue that is already addressing the bug, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/ravedaymond/WinSLink/issues/new)!

Before opening the issue, keep the following in mind:

#### Write Detailed Information

Please do your best to write detailed information about the issue.

For example:

- How to reproduce the issue, step-by-step (as best you can).
- The expected behavior of the application (or what is wrong with the application).
- Screenshots for visible GUI issues.
- The application version you are using.

#### Not sure about what label to use?

If you are unsure what label to use for your issue, please use the <span style="background-color: #d876e3;">&nbsp;**question**&nbsp;</span> label. A contributor can then give it the proper label.

### Feature

Ensure that the feature is not already requested by searching GitHub under the projects [issue tracker](https://github.com/ravedaymond/WinSLink/issues).

If you are unable to find an open feature request already addressing the feature in mind, feel free to open a new feature request by adding the 'feature' tag to a [new issue](https://github.com/ravedaymond/WinSLink/issues/new).
